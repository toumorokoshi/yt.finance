ytfinance
=========

A library of finance tools written in python

Installation
------------

ytfinance requires numpy, which requires the atlas and lapack libraries. On debian-based machines:

  $ sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev libblas-dev

TODO
----
* Fix round methods to always work after the fact, not when values are used for computations.
